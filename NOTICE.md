## ⚠Intellectual Property Protection  

This repository contains **public-facing, limited-functionality components** of the CogniPath™ project. It is intentionally structured to provide educational, research, and demonstration capabilities **without exposing proprietary algorithms, protected language model (LM) prompt structures, or consensus mechanisms**.  

The **private repository (`CogniPath-core`)** contains the protected production-grade implementation, including:  
- Full LM prompt orchestration and optimization logic.  
- Distributed LM consensus algorithms and deterministic decision systems.  
- Advanced replay protection, clearance enforcement, and routing intelligence.  
- Protocol-agnostic interoperability logic (BGP, OSPF, EIGRP integrations).  

These remain confidential and are not part of this public release.

## Patent Status  

The innovations contained in CogniPath™ are protected under a **USPTO Provisional Patent Application (PPA)**, covering:  
- **LM intent-embedded packet networking**  
- **Distributed LM agent consensus routing**  
- **Edge-triggered control-plane inference**  
- **Dynamic LM prompt mutation based on network health telemetry**  
- **Protocol-agnostic compatibility layer for legacy routing interoperation**  

Patent protection extends to all private modules and associated intellectual property.
